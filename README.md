# Traffic-signs-recognation

The project is in the Traffic-signs-classification.ipynb jupyter nootebook.

Model architectures and images contain the images which are used in the jupyter notebook.

In the Testing-with-MNIST.ipynb notebook, the CNN-RF approach has been tested with the MNIST toy dataset to check if it works.

## About the project

The goal of this study is to build and maintain a deep learning model that can discriminate traffic signs with high accuracy.
For this aim, 3 different CNN architectures are built and 3 of these CNN models are combined with a random forest algorithm.
All algorithms are optimized and this grid search method is used for the random forest.
Moreover, by taking into consideration the test accuracies, over-fitting, and computational efficiency, the best model is selected for the image classification.
Therefore, the last testing and the application of the model is done by feed the model with a random image and observe the output of the model.
